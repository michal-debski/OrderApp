# OrderApp
Online Ordering Application
The application was developed for the purpose of passing the bootcamp project.
It assumes service to two types of people: the client and the restaurant owner. 
The restaurant owner should be able to define menus for the restaurants he has previously created.
He also has access to the orders placed by the client at a specific restaurant.
The owner also has access to the ability to add streets to which he delivers food.
In the future, it is planned to add the ability to delete previously created restaurants and update the order status.
